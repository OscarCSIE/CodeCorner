# Introduction
- This presentation covers a racing game built using Python and Pygame.
- We'll walk through the main components and functionality of the code.

# Project Structure
- The project consists of several key components:
  - Asset loading
  - Game initialization
  - Car classes and behavior
  - Game loop and event handling

# Asset Loading
- The assets (images and sounds) are loaded and scaled for use in the game.
- The `scale_image` function is used to resize images.
  

# Game Initialization
- The game window is set up with a specified width and height.
- Pygame components like fonts and mixers are initialized.


# GameInfo Class
- Manages the game state including the current level and timing.
- Provides methods to start levels, reset the game, and check if the game is finished.


# AbstractCar Class
- Defines common functionality for both player and computer cars.
- Includes methods for rotation, movement, drawing, collision detection, and resetting.

# PlayerCar Class
- Inherits from AbstractCar.
- Adds specific behavior for the player-controlled car, such as speed reduction and bouncing on collision.


# ComputerCar Class
- Inherits from AbstractCar.
- Follows a predefined path and adjusts its angle to reach target points.


# Drawing Function
- The `draw` function renders all game elements on the screen.
- Displays the current level, time, and player car velocity.


# Player Movement
- The `move_player` function handles user input for controlling the player car.
- Supports forward, backward, and rotational movement.


# Collision Handling
- The `handle_collision` function manages collisions with track borders and finish lines.
- Triggers actions like bouncing on collision and progressing to the next level.


# Game Loop
- The main game loop runs continuously, updating the game state and rendering frames.
- Checks for game events, updates player and computer car positions, and handles collisions.


# Conclusion
- This racing game demonstrates the use of Pygame for game development in Python.
- Key concepts include asset management, game state handling, and object-oriented programming for game entities.

# Questions
- Feel free to ask any questions about the code or the game development process.
